Hey Mom,

It's been a while since we have chatted, I miss you. Call me when you can, my life is a mess! The other day I went to buy a dollar's worth a candy and it was only 99 cents! I mean the world is crazy now with all these deals and tricks and special promotions. I don't even know what's happening.

Love,

Your Son.
