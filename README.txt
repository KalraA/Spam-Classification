README

This program takes a bunch of data received from the Stanford course, and trains a both linear and gaussian kernel SVM to separate between spam and non-spam data. It has about a 99% accuracy with the linear kernel, while the gaussian kernel overfits too much so it only gets a 94% accuracy on the test set, but a 100% accuracy on the training set.
